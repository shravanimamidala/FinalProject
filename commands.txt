Steps to create a container
===========================================
Step 1: Download Docker Desktop, Python 3.6 version and Jupyter notebook in your local machine if you want to execute in your local machine

Step 2 :See any images are available in your docker by executing the command
	>> docker images
  
Step 3: If "ubuntu","python","jupyter/minimal-notebook" images are missing then we need to create image in the docker
    For Ubuntu : docker run ubuntu:16.04
    For Python : docker run -i -t python:3.6
    For Jupyter Notebook : docker run jupyter/minimal-notebook
    
Step 4 : Verify whether your images are created in your docker by executing the command
	>> docker images
  
Step 5 : Once jupyter/minimal-notebook image is created, You can create container for our jupyter notebook
 >> docker run -p 8888:8888 jupyter/minimal-notebook
 >>docker ps -->For viewing the existing containers in the docker
 
 If everything is installed correctly and all the commands are executed, You can able to see the url details in the log details of the container
 For example : 
 To access the notebook, open this file in a browser
    file:///home/jovyan/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/nbserver-8-open.html
  Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
    http://5b2ab79c3e23:8888/?token=656a8a22c....
      or http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=656a8a22c.....
     
     Here: 5b2ab79c3e23 is the Container ID
